# Laravel Boilerplate

## ðŸ”’ HTTPS Support

This boilerplate includes full HTTPS support with trusted SSL certificates for local development.

### Quick Start with HTTPS

```bash
# One-command setup with custom domain
chmod +x setup-https.sh && ./setup-https.sh

# Or use make
make fresh-start DOMAIN=myapp.test
```

**Note:** The setup scripts automatically detect whether to use `docker compose` or `docker-compose` based on your Docker installation.

Your app will be available at `https://myapp.test` with a green padlock! ðŸŽ‰

For detailed SSL setup instructions, see [docker/SSL-README.md](docker/SSL-README.md).

**Important:** Node modules are isolated inside containers. See [docker/NODE_MODULES.md](docker/NODE_MODULES.md) for details.

### Development Commands

**Important:** Always run npm/node commands inside the Docker container to avoid architecture issues.

```bash
# Run development server
make dev

# Access container shell
make shell

# Install dependencies
make install-deps

# Fix ARM64/M1/M2 node issues
make fix-node-modules
```

For more details, see [docker/DEVELOPMENT.md](docker/DEVELOPMENT.md).

An opinionated Laravel starter kit tailored for rapid development, built by Jonas Vanderhaegen. Includes Docker-based setup, Livewire SPA scaffolding, modular architecture, and more.

## Project-Specific Instructions for AI Assistants

When working with this codebase, AI assistants should:

1. **Check these files first**:
    - `.cursorrules` - IDE-specific rules and project conventions
    - `.ai-instructions.md` - Detailed AI assistant guidelines
    - `README.md` - This file, for project overview
    - Module-specific README files in `Modules/*/README.md`

2. **Follow the modular architecture**:
    - Each feature should be contained within a module
    - Modules are located in the `Modules/` directory
    - Use `php artisan module:*` commands for module operations

3. **Maintain consistency**:
    - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
    - Use the same libraries and tools already in the project
    - Check similar implementations before creating new code

## Important Directories
- `/Modules` - Application modules
- `/app` - Core application code
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/database` - Migrations and seeders
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/resources` - Views and frontend assets

## Coding Standards
This project follows:
- PSR-12 for PHP code style
- Laravel naming conventions
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

For detailed guidelines, see `.cursorrules` and `.ai-instructions.md`.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** This boilerplate reflects my personal preferences and workflow. Pull requests are welcome, though changes may be opinionated.<br>
> For mid to large size projects I just tend to work more modular than all together.

## Features

* **Docker-Only Setup**: Run without installing PHP, Composer, Node, or NPM locally.
* **Livewire SPA**: Single-page application powered by Laravel Livewire and Flowbite.
* **Modular Architecture**: Built-in support for modules (*Core*, Auth, Onboarding, etc.).
* **Custom Scripts**: One-command installation & environment setup.
* **GitHub Actions**: CI for tests, type coverage, and performance optimized workflows.
* **Modern Services**: Postgres, Valkey (Redis replacement), Mailpit for dev email.

---

## Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose installed. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* (Optional) Git client

---

## Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone the repository to local environment**

Example
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:jonasvanderhaegen/laravel-boilerplate.git project
  cd mroject
```

2. **Run the installer script**

> [!TIP]
> please keep your attention to terminal because there'll be some offering prompts.

* **macOS / Linux / WSL**

```bash
  ./scripts/sail.sh
```
* **Windows (CMD/PowerShell/Git Bash)**

```bash
  ./scripts/sail.bat
```

The script will:

  1. Set up docker container with services php 8.4, composer, valkey, mailpit, postgres SQL [and more services can be added by yourself](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sail)
  2. Copy `.env.example` â†’ `.env`
  3. Install Composer & NPM dependencies 
  4. Generate `APP_KEY`
  5. Optionally run database migrations & seeders 
  6. Configure Sail aliases

 ```bash
   # Example aliases added to your shell:
  alias s='sail'
  alias sc='sail composer'
  alias sa='sail artisan'
  alias smf='sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed'
  alias sup='sail up -d'
  alias sus='sail stop'
  alias sr='sail composer run dev'
 ```

3. **Access the application**

    * Frontend: `http://localhost`
    * Mailpit: `http://localhost:8025`
